  - Description: This folder contains smart contracts I created out of curiosity and for experimental purposes.

  #### AccessControl
  - Description: A simple access control smart contract that allows the owner to grant and revoke access to specific functions.

  #### AssemblyTwo
  - Description: A smart contract written in Solidity assembly language to explore and understand low-level Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) operations.

  #### CPAMM
  - Description: Allows users to swap between two ERC-20 tokens and provide liquidity to the trading pair.

  #### CrowdFund
  - Description: A crowdfunding platform for token-based campaigns with pledge, claim, and refund functionalities.

  #### DiscreteStakingRewards
  - Description: Implements staking rewards for users, allowing them to stake, unstake, and claim rewards earned.

  #### GaslessTokenTransfer
  - Description: Enables gasless token transfers, allowing users to send tokens to another address and pay the transaction fee in tokens.

  #### Hodl
  - Description: Allows users to deposit ether for a specified duration and withdraw it after the lock period expires.

  #### Lock
  - Description: Allows an owner to lock ether until a specified unlock time and withdraw it after the unlock time has passed.

  #### MultiDelegatecall
  - Description: Enables multiple delegate calls and returns the results as an array of bytes.

  #### MultiSigWallet
  - Description: Implements a multi-signature wallet, allowing multiple owners to submit, approve, and execute transactions.

  #### MyMultiToken
  - Description: Implements the ERC1155 token standard, allowing users to create and manage multiple token types within a single contract.

  #### StakingRewards
  - Description: Implements a staking rewards mechanism where users can stake ERC20 tokens and receive rewards over a specific duration.

  #### TimeLock
  - Description: Implements a time lock mechanism where transactions must be queued for a minimum time before they can be executed. It helps increase transparency in DAOs and other decentralized systems by allowing users time to review and take action on transactions before they are executed.

  #### Vault
  - Description: Allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens and receive shares in return. These shares can later be used to withdraw the deposited tokens.

  #### YieldFarm
  - Description: A simple yield farming contract that allows users to stake ERC20 tokens and earn rewards over time. The rewards are calculated based on the amount staked and the duration of staking. Additionally, the reward rate decreases over time.
